# NaturalDecay

My first Paper/Spigot/Bukkit plugin. For 1.20.4. Made on 2/17-2/18.

Blocks randomly start getting destroyed around the player (replaced with air).
If a player places a block, it is safe and will not be destroyed.

Use the `/nd` command to start, stop, and change settings.

Exceptions:
```
OBSIDIAN
NETHER_PORTAL
END_PORTAL_FRAME
END_PORTAL
END_GATEWAY
PISTONS
BEDS
CHESTS
DRAGON_EGG
SPAWNER
AIRS
```
